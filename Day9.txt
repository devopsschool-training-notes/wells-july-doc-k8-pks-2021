Authentication

How i can login to "API Server" & other components
- Certificate
- Token
- OpenID
- Web Hook

How Certificate Based Auth Works?
---------------------------------


How Token Based Auth Works?
---------------------------------

# USER run these commands in Workstation
# Create a pvt key
$ openssl genrsa -out employee.key 2048

# Create CSR file
$ openssl req -new -key employee.key -out employee.csr -subj "/CN=employee/O=bitnami"

# How to send a CSR file to CA (Master Admin or K8s admin)
- Send via manual way eg. email
- csr api

# Admin run these commands in Workstation
$ openssl x509 -req -in employee.csr -CA /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -CAkey /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out employee.crt -days 500

# Admin would send employee.crt to USER.
- Send via manual way eg. email 
- csr api - they can download self

# USER would set employee.key & employee.crt in CONFIG file.

$ kubectl config set-credentials employee --client-certificate=/root/employee.crt  --client-key=/root/employee.key

$ kubectl config view

$ kubectl config set-context employee-context --cluster=kubernetes --namespace=office --user=employee

$ kubectl config view

$ kubectl create namespace office

$ kubectl --context=employee-context get pods

[root@rajesh ~]# kubectl --context=employee-context get pods
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "employee" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "office"
# Only we have enabled employee authentication. He has no rights on K8s.


How to Authorized user in kubernetes clustor?
--------------------------------------------
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/

WHOM - USER or GROUP
WHAT - verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"] # You can also use ["*"] 
WHERE - API Resources or API Group $ kubectl api-resources
How???
- Node
- ABAC 
- RBAC 		[ FOCUS ] 
- Webhook 

How RBAC works?
-----------------------
ROlE BASED ACCESS CONTROL
-----------------------------
ROLE TYPE
- role: This to be used for graning access to Namespace
- clustorrole: This to be used for graning access to Clustor

User Type
- User: like me.
- Service Account: a user which is used by system

role contains
- WHAT - verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"] # You can also use ["*"] 
- WHERE - API Resources or API Group $ kubectl api-resources 
&
WHOM - USER OR& GROUP or& Service Account #using ROLE BINDING

clustorrole contains
- WHAT - verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"] # You can also use ["*"] 
- WHERE - API Resources or API Group $ kubectl api-resources 
&
WHOM - USER OR& GROUP or& Service Account #using CLUSTORROLE BINDING

Kubernetes Storage and Volumes Explained in crash way

#Storage Types?
- BLOCK Storage
e.g - Laptop, ebs, disks, 
- Network Storage
e.g - NFS, efs, files
- OBJECT STORAGE
e.g - git, google drive, s3, blob

#How we can make kubernetes understanding these storage types for using in pods?
- "volume plugins" which is in built in kubernetes

#What are the volume plugins supported in kubernetes?
- awsElasticBlockStore - AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- azureDisk - Azure Disk
- azureFile - Azure File
- cephfs - CephFS volume
- cinder - Cinder (OpenStack block storage) (deprecated)
- csi - Container Storage Interface (CSI)
- fc - Fibre Channel (FC) storage
- flexVolume - FlexVolume
- flocker - Flocker storage
- gcePersistentDisk - GCE Persistent Disk
- glusterfs - Glusterfs volume
- hostPath - HostPath volume (for single node testing only; WILL NOT WORK in a multi-node cluster; consider using local volume instead)
- iscsi - iSCSI (SCSI over IP) storage
- local - local storage devices mounted on nodes.
- nfs - Network File System (NFS) storage
- photonPersistentDisk - Photon controller persistent disk. (This volume type no longer works since the removal of the corresponding - cloud provider.)
- portworxVolume - Portworx volume
- quobyte - Quobyte volume
- rbd - Rados Block Device (RBD) volume
- scaleIO - ScaleIO volume (deprecated)
- storageos - StorageOS volume
- vsphereVolume - vSphere VMDK volume

#Role & Responsibilties
Who would  Add "Storage types" in clustor - kubernetes clustor administrator
Who would  Use attached volume in clustor - kubernetes user and developer

#How to Add "Storage types" using "volume plugins" to the kubernetes clustor by clustor administrator?
